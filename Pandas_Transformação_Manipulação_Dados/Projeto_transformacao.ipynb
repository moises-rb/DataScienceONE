The house is conveniently located: 2.5 miles from the University of Washington (bus #44), 1.5 miles to Seattle Pacific University, 5.0 miles to Downtown Seattle (bus #5), 4.5 miles to Golden Gardens beach. Walk to Green Lake Park, local restaurants, Burke-Gilman bike trail, coffee shops, zoo, rose garden, Peak Park (awesome view!!). We are also just inside a mile\\'s walk from Seattle\\'s \"Silicon Canal\" where Tableau, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Adobe, Impinj, Brooks and others host their local offices.', \"Within 60 seconds to ten minutes:   Woodland Park Zoo, UW, Ballard Locks, marinas, Gas Works Park, Archie McPhee, 50 coffee shops, Fremont Troll, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), Jai Thai, Bizarro's, 45th Street Guild, golf, tennis, bike rentals, bus lines, Center for Wooden Boats, Golden Gates Park music and bonfires, Shilshole Marina, kayaking, sailing, waterfront restaurants, Green Lake...  Just doesn't get any better.\", '--', \"Fremont is only 15 minutes from downtown by bus, and 10 if you're driving! The #5 picks up one block from my house, and the E Line picks up about 5 blocks away on the Aurora (99) freeway stop, above N 46th street. The neighborhood has a diverse history, which is seen throughout public art and community events, like the Nude Cyclists in the Solstice Parade. And Gasworks Park– the hidden gem of Seattle–is a mere 25 minute walk away. The smaller, quaint lot, Peak Park, has a great view of the sunset over Ballard, and is only 5 minutes away. I'm also by the Woodland Park Zoo, several killer local restaurants & independent shops, and the Green Lake hiking trails/day use park. If there's something more you want, I'll help you find it!\", \"The neighborhood is amazing.  It's super quirky. There's a giant cement troll across the street, and a giant statue of communist Lenin!  We've got a lot of local shops and restaurants a block away.  Everything imaginable is within walking distance. We are right by Lake Union, and there's always sailboats and yachts floating around.  There's a bunch of places to see a show/do some dancing (The High Dive, Nectar)!\", '--']",
